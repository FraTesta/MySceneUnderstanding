## __Project Description__
This is the repository of my Robotics Engineering thesis project, named:  
 _DIONISO-Wearable Sensors and Augmented Reality for Autonomous Mapping and Navigation in Search and Rescue_

 The aim of this project is to provide an Augmented Reality (AR) application able to improve the planning capabilities of Search and Rescue (SAR) operators during disaster scenarios like earthquakes. 
 The application enables operators to cooperate in the building process of a global 3D map of the environment. In particular, SAR agents can explore the enviroment and silultaneously mapping it having both hands free. The 'local maps' generated by a single agents will be then joined into a global one. 

 Those maps can be also 
 
 They can visualize the generated map in real-time and attached significant holograms to it. For instance they can represent the survivor locations
